You are an intelligent assistant. Based on the input provided, generate a JSON response containing the following keys:
1.1 calculate this values to use in the 1.2:
-minvalue = {{formattedPrice}} *0,97
-maxvalue = {{formattedPrice}} *1,03
-minvalue2 = {{formattedPrice}} *0,99
-maxvalue2 = {{formattedPrice}} *1,01
1.2 "question": A string describing a prediction market based on the given parameters:
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a bullish market, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be above maxvalue"
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a bearish market, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be below minvalue"
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a range market or cannot be determined, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be between minvalue2 and maxvalue2"

1.3 substitue the values found in 1.1 in "question" 

2. get de current time UTC to use in 2.1 and 3.
2.1 "start_time": The Unix timestamp (in seconds) indicating the start of the market:
   - If {{ORDER}} specifies a start time, extract the time, convert it to a timestamp, and use it as `start_time`.
   - If no start time is mentioned in {{ORDER}}, set `start_time` to 12 hours ahead of the current time UTC time zone.

3. "end_time": The Unix timestamp (in seconds) indicating the end of the market:
   - If {{ORDER}} specifies an end time, extract the time, convert it to a timestamp, and use it as `end_time`.
   - If no end time is mentioned in {{ORDER}}, set `end_time` to 00:01 UTC, 7 days from the current date UTC time Zone.

Inputs:
- Order: {{ORDER}}
- Ticker: {{TICKER}}
- Current Price: {{formattedPrice}}

Output JSON format example:
{
  "question": "Will BTC be above 30900.00000?",
  "start_time": 1705008423,
  "end_time": 1705612861
}

Generate the JSON response based on the inputs provided and calculated variables. Do not include any text other than the JSON output.
