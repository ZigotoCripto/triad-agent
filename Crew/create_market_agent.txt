- If {{ORDER}} indicates a bearish market, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be below minvalue"
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a range market or cannot be determined, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be between minvalue2 and maxvalue2"

- Order: {{ORDER}}
- Ticker: {{TICKER}}
- Current Price: {{formattedPrice}}
- Current Time: {{DATE}}

Output JSON format example:
{
  "question": "Will BTC be above 30900.00? on 10, february",
