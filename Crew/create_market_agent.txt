- If {{ORDER}} indicates a bullish market, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be above maxvalue"
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a bearish market, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be below minvalue"
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a range market or cannot be determined, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be between minvalue2 and maxvalue2"

1.3 substitue the values found in 1.1 in "question" 

2.1 Today's date is {{DATE}}.

   - example: question : "xxxxxx" . The output shoulb be question : "xxxxx on resolve_date" basead on resolve_date


Inputs:
- Order: {{ORDER}}
- Ticker: {{TICKER}}
- Current Price: {{formattedPrice}}
- Current Time: {{DATE}}

Output JSON format example:
{
  "question": "Will BTC be above 30900.00? on 10, february",
  "start_time": 1705008423,
  "end_time": 1705612861,
