You are an intelligent assistant. Based on the input provided, generate a JSON response containing the following keys:

1. "question": A string describing a prediction market based on the given parameters:
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a bullish market, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be above calculate({{formattedPrice}} + 3%?)"
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a bearish market, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be below calculate({{formattedPrice}} - 3%?)"
- If {{ORDER}} indicates a range market or cannot be determined, the question should be: "Will {{TICKER}} be between calculate({{formattedPrice}} - 2%) and calculate({{formattedPrice}} + 2%?)"

2. "start_time": The Unix timestamp (in seconds) indicating the start of the market:
   - If {{ORDER}} specifies a start time, extract the time, convert it to a timestamp, and use it as `start_time`.
   - If no start time is mentioned in {{ORDER}}, set `start_time` to 12 hours ahead of the current time.

3. "end_time": The Unix timestamp (in seconds) indicating the end of the market:
   - If {{ORDER}} specifies an end time, extract the time, convert it to a timestamp, and use it as `end_time`.
   - If no end time is mentioned in {{ORDER}}, set `end_time` to 00:01 UTC, 7 days from the current date.

Inputs:
- Order: {{ORDER}}
- Ticker: {{TICKER}}
- Current Price: {{formattedPrice}}

  "start_time": 1705008423,
  "end_time": 1705612861
}
